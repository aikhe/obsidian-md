Activity 2:
I. Identify the significant contributions of the Spaniards and Americans to the
Philippine Arts.

An answer "brought to life" by none other than our former guests (or should we say, uninvited housemates?): the Spaniards and the Americans. 

Spanish Era: More than just what identifies as "Simbahang Baroque"

The Spaniards, they arrived in the Philippines in the 16th century with the three G’s: God, Gold, and Glory. But let’s focus on the ‘God’ part here because of the historial marks they leave on Philippine art through their religious fervor. The most visible contributions are the magnificent Baroque churches scattered across the archipelago. These architectural marvels aren't just places of worship; they're a testament to a fusion of local craftsmanship and European aesthetics. It’s like having a piece of Europe in the tropics, minus the cold weather.

But it wasn't all bricks and mortar. The Spaniards introduced new forms of visual arts, including painting and sculpture, predominantly with religious themes. Think of it as the Instagram of the era, where saints and biblical scenes were the influencers, capturing the hearts and minds of the people. These art forms were not just for devotion but also a means of communication, considering not everyone was keen on reading back then.

American Period: "Ang Pagbubukang-Liwayway" (art influence)

Fast forward to the late 19th century, and the Americans decided it was their turn to crash the party. Unlike the Spaniards, the Americans brought over a new educational system, which included the arts as a significant component. This was revolutionary; it was like upgrading from a Nokia 3310 to a smartphone in terms of artistic literacy and exposure.

The introduction of cinema, a.k.a. the greatest pastime of modern Filipinos, was another game-changer. The Philippines embraced this new medium with open arms, creating a unique film industry that’s both a mirror and a window to the Filipino psyche. It's like watching your life unfold on screen, but with better lighting and more dramatic music.

Moreover, the Americans promoted the use of English, which not only opened the doors to global literature but also allowed Filipino artists to express themselves in a language that broadened their audience. This period saw the emergence of new art forms, including modern painting, literature, and theater, which reflected the complexities of Philippine society under American rule.

"It’s as if the Filipino were given a new palette of colors to paint their stories, not in a dark vivid hues but in shades of gray that captured the nuances of each historical experience."

II. Answer the following questions:
1. What message do vertical lines send to a viewer? What message do diagonal
lines send?

**Vertical Lines** convey strength, stability, and height. They're straightforward, suggesting a sense of grandeur and formality. In contrast, **Diagonal Lines** imply movement, action, and dynamism. They introduce a sense of energy and tension, as if suggesting a shift or change is occurring within the artwork.

2. What are the principles of art?

- **Balance** ensures visual equilibrium and stability in the artwork.
- **Contrast** highlights differences, creating visual interest and focus.
- **Emphasis** directs attention to the focal point, making it stand out.
- **Movement** guides the viewer’s eye through the artwork, creating a narrative or flow.
- **Pattern** involves repeating elements to create a sense of order or decoration.
- **Rhythm** uses recurring elements to create a visual tempo or beat.
- **Unity** achieves a sense of harmony, where all components of the artwork feel cohesive and complete.

3. How can emphasis be created in a work of art?
   
To spotlight the main feature (emphasis) within an artwork:
- Utilize **Contrast** by setting the focal point apart through differences in color, shape, or texture.
- Manipulate **Size and Scale**, making the focal point larger or more commanding than other elements.
- Consider **Placement**, positioning the focal point in a strategic location within the composition.
- Employ **Use of Lines**, guiding the viewer's gaze towards the focal point with directional lines. 
  
Identify and discuss the subject of the iconic painting "The Birth of Venus by Sandro Boticelli"

First, the subject. Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty, emerging from the sea as a fully grown woman. This painting, created in the mid-1480s, is not just about showing off Botticelli's mad skills with a brush. Nope, it's packed with symbolism and has a story to tell that goes beyond its surface beauty.

Venus is standing on a giant shell, being blown towards the shore by Zephyr, the god of the west wind, who's getting a little help from Aura, the personification of a lighter breeze. Meanwhile, on the shore, one of the Horae, goddesses of the seasons, is ready to clothe Venus with a lavish garment. it's an allegory of the birth of beauty and its arrival into the material world, showcasing the Neoplatonic view that human beings should strive to achieve divine beauty.

What makes "The Birth of Venus" stand out, apart from its obvious aesthetic appeal, is how Botticelli decided to give us a classical mythology throwback in a time dominated by Christian themes. This was the Renaissance, where artists started to look back at pagan themes with a new, adoring gaze, blending them with their present to create something timeless. And Botticelli did just that, but with a level of detail and elegance that makes your favorite Instagram filter look like child's play.

In my case "The Birth of Venus" isn't just a stunning piece of art; it's a blend of mythology, beauty, and Renaissance swagger that continues to capture our imaginations centuries later. And let's be honest, if Venus had Instagram today, she'd be the ultimate influencer (well, with complete innocency).

Question: Why did you choose it? Elaborate your answer.

Movie: "Heneral Luna" (2015)

**Why I Chose It:** "Heneral Luna" is a compelling historical biopic that portrays the life of General Antonio Luna, a fiery and strategic general who fought during the Philippine-American War. This film was chosen not just for its cinematic excellence but for its audacious portrayal of patriotism, leadership, and the complexities of internal conflict within a country fighting for its independence.

Novel: "Noli Me Tangere" by José Rizal

**Why I Chose It:** Penned by the national hero José Rizal, "Noli Me Tangere" (Touch Me Not) is a novel that's essentially the 'receipts' of the Spanish colonial era's societal abuses and injustices in the Philippines. This novel is a masterclass in using literature as a tool for awakening and revolution. It's like the Facebook rant of the 19th century that actually sparks a real revolution.

Poem: "Sa Aking Mga Kabata" by José Rizal

**Why I Chose It:** Often attributed to José Rizal, "Sa Aking Mga Kabata" (To My Fellow Youth) emphasizes the significance of one's native language as a source of national identity and pride. Choosing this poem reflects the timeless message of loving and embracing one's culture and language amidst colonization and modern globalization. It's akin to reminding every Filipino to wear their "Pinoy Pride" on their sleeves, quite literally.

Music: "Anak" by Freddie Aguilar

**Why I Chose It:** "Anak" (Child) is a folk rock ballad that narrates the life of a wayward child and his journey to redemption and understanding. Its universal themes of parental love, regret, and forgiveness crossed global boundaries, making it an anthem for many Filipino households. It's the kind of song that plays in the background of every Filipino reunion, eliciting both eye rolls and heartfelt tears.

Architectural Structure: The Coconut Palace

**Why I Chose It:** Coconut Palace is a unique architectural marvel made almost entirely of coconut shells and other indigenous materials, showcasing Filipino ingenuity and sustainability. It stands as a testament to the versatility of the coconut, not just as a food source but as a viable building material.

Clothing: Barong

**Why I Chose It:** Barong is the national attire of the Philippines, symbolizing Filipino craftsmanship and elegance. Made from piña (pineapple fiber) or jusi (banana silk), it embodies the tropical and hospitable spirit of the Filipinos. Wearing a Barong idetifies to me as, "I am Filipino, and I am proud," but in the most stylish and breezy way possible.
