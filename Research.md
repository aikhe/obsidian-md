1. Why is research practical and realistic?

Research and researching is a huge part of human made literatures as it is the basis of each and every physical understanding of the planet, which is in fact a factor of our survivability.

2. The first step of research process is to develop your topic or research problem.

As humane as we are, every second of our lives are based upon the problems we ourselves make and the solutions we humans are reliant upon as if it very much complinents our own misery and successes and so we apply each steps in every part of our lives.
Research is also the same, what we are ought' to survive was the very first reason we ask the why's and what—we discover and develop to survive as it is to the topic and so we dig deeper to reseach and solve each of the problems that is originating from the topic itself.

- What is the importance of considering those factors in selecting a research problem?

In essence, the very first rule of being a human was to survive, reproduce and iterate, this cycle is what we are conditioned to be, and as a very enthusiastic of a person I am... I ask why? Why do we humans are conditioned this way? and so I ask an artificial intelligence (asking this to a normal person would be really embarassing), why is it realy that humans need to be constrained the way we are? the AI responded; social order, safety, moral, ethical standards, psychological well-being, resource management, fairness, equity and economic stability, all this words that sum up to the term "harmony".
Harmony as it is to the word facts—a fact that is reliable, authentic, dependable, genuine and in most case: important. All in all the factors I've provided was a very well grounded and important one.
 
3. Explain briefly. Research starts with a problem and ends with a new problem.

Research begins when we identify a problem that needs to be solved. As we study this problem and find an answer, we often discover new questions that need answers, too. This is because learning more about one thing can show us what we still don't know about others. So, when one research project ends, it usually points us towards the next problem to solve, keeping the cycle of learning going.

4. What is the purpose of research ethics in doing research work?

Relying and rooting for ethics in every research are important because they help us conduct our studies in a fair and honest way. These rules protect the people and animals involved in research, make sure that the results are trustworthy, and that the benefits of research are shared fairly. Following ethical guidelines also helps maintain the public’s trust in research, ensuring people feel safe participating in or benefiting from it.

5. A research can be replicated but not the findings. Why?

Research methods can be repeated, meaning anyone can follow the same steps under similar conditions to see if they get the same results. However, the exact findings might not always be the same because of small differences in conditions, timing, or the participants involved. These differences mean that while the overall pattern or conclusion might be confirmed, the specific results can vary with each new attempt. This variability is normal and helps scientists understand how general or reliable their results are.























2. **Ano ang first step sa research process?**
Ang first step sa research process ay ang pag-develop ng iyong topic o research problem. Parang pag pili mo ng karaoke song, dapat alam mo kung ano ang kakantahin mo para mapaghandaan mo. Sa research, kailangan mong malaman kung ano ang gusto mong malaman o solusyonan para focused at organized ang iyong pag-aaral.

2.5. **Bakit mahalaga ang pag-consider ng mga factors sa pagpili ng research problem?**
Mahalaga ang pag-consider ng factors tulad ng relevance, feasibility, at originality sa pagpili ng research problem dahil ito ang magiging foundation ng iyong research. Parang pagtatayo ng bahay, kung mahina ang foundation, babagsak din ang bahay. Kung matino ang pinili mong problema, mas effective at useful ang magiging resulta ng iyong pag-aaral.

3. **Ipaliwanag briefly. Ang research ay nagsisimula sa problema at nagtatapos sa bagong problema.**
Ang research ay parang isang cycle – nagsisimula tayo sa isang problema, at kapag natapos natin ang research, kadalasan ay may bago na namang problema na lumilitaw mula sa mga findings. Hindi ito bad news; sa katunayan, maganda ito dahil it means na nag-eexpand ang ating knowledge at nakikita natin ang mga bagong oportunidad para mag-improve at matuto pa.

4. **Ano ang purpose ng research ethics sa paggawa ng research work?**
Ang purpose ng research ethics ay para siguraduhin na ang research ay ginagawa sa isang honest at moral na paraan. Ito ang nagbibigay proteksyon hindi lang sa mga participants kundi pati na rin sa integrity ng research process. Isipin mo ito bilang mga rules ng basketball; kailangan ang rules para fair ang game at respetado ang lahat ng players.

5. **Bakit ang research ay maaring i-replicate pero hindi ang findings?**
Isang research ay maaring i-replicate, meaning ulitin ang process para malaman kung consistent ba ang results. Pero, ang findings mismo, hindi laging pareho dahil depende ito sa maraming variables tulad ng sample size, location, or timing. Ito ay parang pagluluto ng adobo – kahit na pareho ang recipe, may pagkakaiba pa rin sa lasa depende kung sino o saan ito niluto. Kaya mahalaga ang replication para makita natin kung gaano ka-reliable at valid ang mga findings ng isang study.
